# Assignment 10: Template Engine - Employee Summary

The following application allows a manager to generate a team html page through the CLI by prompting them for a series of questions on professional information about themselves and their employees through node.

## Bugs

* Although the team page is successfully created from the prompts, at the moment, the page only contains the manager and one employee, as I am unsure how to loop the prompts so that more employees can be added to the team

* Moreover, I am unsure how to allow the user to continue with the prompts if the answer of the confirm is "yes," or to end the session if the answer of the confirms is "no"
